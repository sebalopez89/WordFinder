# WordFinder
The WordFinder class is designed to process a matrix of words and find the top 10 most repeated words (including their reversed forms) in a given word stream.
It takes the value for the matrix and the possible words from two files (wordMatrix.txt, wordStream.txt)
It employs various methods for validation, counting occurrences, and word reversal to achieve its functionality.

# Resolution approach
In order to resolve this exercise I took advantage from LINQ capacities and I used ChatGPT to create the basic code.
I left the previous versions of the class in the project so you can check the improvements.
There are some unit tests created that checks the main behavior.
